UntamedChat
============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ProxyConn/UntamedChat.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ProxyConn/UntamedChat)

<br>UntamedChat is a simple to use plugin that has support for ProxyConn and RedisBungee or standalone setups. <br>
With automatic integration UntamedChat is as easy to install as dropping a jar file in BungeeCords's plugins folder.<br><br>

Configuration
==============
You can configure a large amount of things in the config.json file (plugins/UntamedChat/config.json). This includes setting
aliases for commands, default behaviour, spam messages/cooldowns and chat formatting.<br><br>

Downloads
==========
More info is available [here](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/untamedchat.2520/).
Official downloads are [here](https://github.com/ProxyConn/UntamedChat/releases/latest).

Multi-Bungee Info
==================
UntamedChat will automatically check if you are using either ProxyConn or RedisBungee, this being said I do not offer support for
RedisBungee. If you need help with that then contact the developer [here](http://minecraft.minimum.io/wiki/Support). For support
with ProxyConn please contact me or make an issue on this repository.<br>
